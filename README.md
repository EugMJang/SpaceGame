# SpaceGame

SpaceGame is a game made using Pygame. Shoot the enemy ships before they attack your base and deplete your health.

## Installation
Download the files and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 game.py
```
(may vary based on operating system)

## Usage
Move the mouse around to aim the gun and click to shoot. Enemies will start depleting your health once they touch you. Once you reach 0 hp (as shown in your healthbar), you lose and the program quits.

## TODO
- Add a menu screen and a game over screen
- Make different enemies (add a boss maybe?)
- Ramp up difficulty as you keep on surviving
- Get powerups
- etc. Feel free to suggest any other changes!
